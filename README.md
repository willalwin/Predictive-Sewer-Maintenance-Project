# Capstone prjoject/Predictive maintenance application

This is my final project for my CS bachelor, it is a project done for Washoe County that attempts to predicts maintenance need for sewer mains based on amount of flow through pipes. There is a much more thorough write up included in word file, feel free to read through that in order to see what techniques/algorithms were used.
