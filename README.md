# Capstone project/Predictive maintenance application

This is my final project for my CS bachelor, it was done for Washoe County and attempts to predicts maintenance need for sewer mains based on amount of flow through pipes. There is a much more thorough write up included in a word file, feel free to read through that in order to see what techniques/algorithms were used.
